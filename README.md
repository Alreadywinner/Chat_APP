# Chat_APP

## Getting Started
This repository aims to assist you in beginning work on a MERN stack application with a solid file structure as a foundation. To get started make a copy of this template repo for your project teams.

Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places. First run `npm install` from the root. After this you will run `npm run dev` from the root to run conncurrently the server and the client. From now on run this command anytime you want to install all modules again. This is a script we have defined in package.json .


## File structure
#### `client` - Holds the client application
- #### `public` - This holds all of our static files
- #### `src`
    - #### `assets` - This folder holds assets such as images, docs, and fonts
    - #### `components` - This folder holds all of the different components that will make up our views
    - #### `App.js` - This is what renders all of views
    - #### `index.js` - This is what renders the react app by rendering App.js, should not change
- #### `package.json` - Defines npm behaviors and packages for the client
#### `index.js` - Holds the server application
- #### `controllers` - These hold all of the callback functions that each route will call
- #### `routes` - This holds all of our HTTP to URL path associations for each unique url
#### `package.json` - Defines npm behaviors like the scripts defined in the next section of the README
#### `.gitignore` - Tells git which files to ignore
#### `README` - This file!


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs both the client app and the server app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:5000) to view the client in the browser.

### `npm run client`

Runs just the client app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.


### `npm run index`

Runs just the server in development mode.<br>


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
